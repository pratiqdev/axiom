# Axiom

This is a basic personal project for exploring and learning about authoring / content management systems, 

Browse `src/docs/` or use [The App](localhost-for-now)

*Maybe now I will take more notes?*  
View `axiom/NOTES.md` for other stupid questions and half-answers

## Main Goal

An organized collection of notes - like a personal wiki

> Much of the content from this repo / app will be copied from, referenced to, loosely interpreted from and/or simplified versions of official documentation - which should be used instead if available:
>
> - [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com)
> - [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com)
> - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)
> - [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com)
## Other Goals

An automatically categorized (based on directory structure), searchable collection of:

- articles
- guides
- terminology / definitions
- usage / samples / examples
- sources
- codepens / sandboxes

for use as a publicly available reference for myself and other junior web devs.

## Contribute

I am a junior developer / programmer - any suggestions, guides or help would be greatly appreciated.
I will be continually adding to this repo (my notes, you see) and will likely make mistakes at a consistent rate. If / when you find any errors, please create a **new issue** and I will *attempt* to fix it.
