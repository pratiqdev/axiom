\#Web Design

Responsive design is the idea that web pages - and content displayed within them - 'respond' to the size and shape of the viewport it appears on. This design method ensures that content appears exactly how it was intended / designed.

Websites often use various styles, each built with a different screen size, shape or mobile device in mind, and switch between these styles as needed.  Important content can stay centered and in focus as less-important info can be hidden or removed when it no longer fits on screen.

The most common method of achieving this is [media queries] in the css or sass stylesheets, although some sites and apps will serve a completely different version of the [markup].
