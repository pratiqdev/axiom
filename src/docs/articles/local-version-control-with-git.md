[Git] is a powerful version control tool.

Most users are familiar with using GitHub's online service / UI to manage projects, but Git can also be used offline in the same way.

We can still use common git commands like:

```code
git add ./this/file
git commit -m 'My first commit'
```

<!-- ? how do we configure a local dir to be used as the repo?  -->

Done! now instead of 'pushing' these changes to the origin / repo, they are just committed to a local version history, and stored in the local repo.

Managing and tracking projects privately . If, one day, we decide to move our files to an online repository - we can simply:

```code
git push origin main // or whatever branch 
```

- the commit history will be preserved.
