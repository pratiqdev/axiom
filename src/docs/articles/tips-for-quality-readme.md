README.md files are typically the first exposure a viewer or user has to your project and should be used to explain or guide them. Even great projects can suffer from poor readme creation.

> Compare this [bad-readme] to this [good-readme].

Here are some things to consider when writing your readme files:
<!-- ! read the official github docs for instructions -->

- **What is this project?**
At least provide a complete description of what this project is and how it will / should be used and why this would be used in place of another.
- **Who is this project for?**  
The intended users of this project should be able to navigate the directories, install, configure and use your code quickly and easily.

- **Problems and pitfalls to watch out for**  
  Documentation should alert the users to common errors or pitfalls when using your code with other modules / packages.

- **Put advanced details in the wiki**  
  In-depth explanations and guides should exist in the GitHub wiki

- **Full guide on GitHub**  
Read the official guides for readme files on GitHub
